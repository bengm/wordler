# Wordler

## Word Lists

I grabbed the overall word list from the system, then filtered that down to a list of 5-letter words. See `generate_5_letter_words.sh` for the details.

## HTML/CSS Framework

[Terminal CSS](https://terminalcss.xyz/) is the base for the HTML/CSS.

## JS Frameworks

None! I wanted to try it using plain old JS. So far, so good.

## Feature Roadmap

* Word Scoring - score all possible match words as to how similar they are to other remaining match words.
* Play as Bot - actually play the game driven from the app.
